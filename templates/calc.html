        <h3>Going For It</h3>
        <p>
        A first down in this situation would be worth 
        {{ d['go_for_it']['expected_points_success'] }} points, and a turnover 
        on downs would cost 
        {{ d['go_for_it']['expected_points_failure'] }} points. 
        {% if winner_ep == 'go_for_it' %}
        The total expected points from going for it 
        ({{ d['go_for_it']['expected_points_total'] }}) exceeds the 
        expected points from punting ({{ d['punt']['expected_points_total'] }})
        or kicking a field goal ({{ d['field_goal']['expected_points_total'] }}).
        {% else %}
        It would be worth it if teams converted more than 
        {{ d['go_for_it']['expected_break_even'] }} of their fourth down 
        attempts, however NFL teams in this position only have a 
        {{ d['go_for_it']['expected_success_rate'] }} chance of getting a 
        first down.

        Choosing to punt costs the team 0.78 points, which means punting is the best decision.

    <!--A made field goal here is worth 2.4 points, but a miss would cost the team 1.44 points. On average, teams make 55% of their kicks from this distance, which means kicking a field goal is the best decision.-->
